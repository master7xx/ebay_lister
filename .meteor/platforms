# Server code

# The server is responsible for listening for incoming requests from clients (e.g. web browsers)
# and sending a response back to the client once the request has been processed.
# The server is initialized with a host and port, which specify the address and port number
# that the server should listen on for incoming requests.
# Once the server is started, it will listen for incoming requests and process them using
# the process_request function.
# The server can be stopped by calling the stop method.

def start_server(host, port):
    # Initialize the server with the given host and port
    server = Server(host, port)

    # Start the server
    server.start()

    # The server will continue running until it is stopped
    while True:
        pass

def process_request(request):
    # Process the given request and return a response
    # Implementation details go here

    return response


# Browser code

# The browser is a software application used to access and display web pages on the internet.
# The browser is initialized with a URL, which specifies the web page that the browser
# should load.
# Once the browser is started, it will load the web page specified by the URL
# and display it to the user.

def start_browser(url):
    # Initialize the browser with the given URL
    browser = Browser(url)

    # Start the browser
    browser.start()

    # The browser will continue running until the web page has been loaded
    while not browser.page_loaded:
        pass
