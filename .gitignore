// It exports a single object with methods for creating, updating, and destroying charts.
// For example, the `createChart` method takes a DOM element and chart data as arguments, and returns a new chart instance.

  updateChart: (chartInstance, updatedData) => { /* implementation */ },
  destroyChart: (chartInstance) => { /* implementation */ }

<!-- This file contains an HTML template for rendering charts in the client-side application. -->
<!-- It uses Handlebars syntax to define placeholders for dynamic data. -->
<!-- For example, the `{{title}}` placeholder will be replaced with the chart's title
